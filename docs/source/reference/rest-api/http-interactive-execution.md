# HTTP Interactive Execution

NeMo Agent Toolkit supports interactive workflows (Human-in-the-Loop and OAuth) over plain HTTP,
without requiring a WebSocket connection. This is useful in deployment environments where WebSocket
support is limited.

When enabled, the interactive extensions allow HTTP clients to:

- Start a workflow execution and receive an execution ID
- Poll for execution status (running, interaction required, OAuth required, completed, or failed)
- Submit interaction responses (text, binary choice, radio, checkbox, dropdown, or notification acknowledgment)
- Handle OAuth2 authorization code flows through status polling

Two client integration patterns are supported:

- **Polling mode**: The server returns `202 Accepted` with an execution ID. The client polls
  `GET /executions/{execution_id}` until the workflow completes or requires interaction.
- **Streaming mode (SSE)**: The server streams workflow output as Server-Sent Events. When an
  interaction or OAuth flow is needed, a typed SSE event is emitted. The client submits its
  response, and the stream resumes.

## Configuration

HTTP interactive extensions are enabled by default on all workflow endpoints **except for**
OpenAI-compatible endpoints (`/v1/chat/completions`). To force the interactive extension to work
with OpenAI-compatible endpoints, set `enable_interactive_extensions` to `true` in the FastAPI
front-end configuration:

```yaml
general:
  front_end:
    _type: fastapi
    enable_interactive_extensions: true
```

The following table describes the relevant configuration parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enable_interactive_extensions` | boolean | `false` | Enable HTTP interactive execution on OpenAI-compatible endpoints. When `true`, POST requests to chat and OpenAI-compatible endpoints (`/v1/chat/completions`) return `202 Accepted` if the workflow pauses for interaction or OAuth |
| `disable_legacy_routes` | boolean | `false` | Disable legacy endpoint paths (`/generate`, `/chat`). When `true`, only versioned paths with interactive support (`/v1/workflow`, `/v1/chat`) are registered |
| `oauth2_callback_path` | string | `/auth/redirect` | Path for the OAuth2 authorization code grant callback endpoint |

:::{note}
Interactive extensions are enabled for versioned **workflow** and **chat** endpoints (for example,
`/v1/workflow` and `/v1/chat`).

OpenAI-compatible endpoints (`/v1/chat/completions`) are opt-in only (defaulting to disabled).

    Start(["Start workflow"])
    Running(["Running"])
    Interaction(["Interaction Required"])
    OAuth(["OAuth Required"])
    Completed(["Completed"])

    style Running fill:#006699,color:#fff,stroke:#003366
```

## Endpoints

### Starting an Execution (Polling Mode)

POST requests to versioned endpoints such as `/v1/chat` return a `202 Accepted` response if the
workflow requires interaction or OAuth before it can complete. Interactive support is enabled by
default on these endpoints; the `enable_interactive_extensions` flag only gates OpenAI-compatible
endpoints (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Analyze the sales data"}
    ]
  }'
```

**Response (202 Accepted, interaction required):**

```json
{
  "status": "interaction_required",
  "status_url": "/executions/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "interaction_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "prompt": {
    "input_type": "text",
    "text": "Should I include Q4 projections?",
    "placeholder": "Type your response...",
    "required": true,
    "timeout": null,
    "error": null
  },
  "response_url": "/executions/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/interactions/a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890/response"
}
```

The `error` field inside the `prompt` object is only populated when the prompt times out or becomes
unavailable. Under normal operation it is `null`.

**Response (202 Accepted, OAuth required):**

```json
{
  "status": "oauth_required",
  "status_url": "/executions/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "auth_url": "https://provider.example.com/authorize?client_id=...&state=abc123",
  "oauth_state": "abc123"
}
```

If the workflow completes without requiring interaction, a standard `200 OK` response with the
workflow result is returned, identical to the non-interactive behavior.

### Getting Execution Status

Poll the execution status endpoint to check progress or retrieve the final result.

- **Route:** `GET /executions/{execution_id}`
- **Description:** Returns the current status of an execution.

**Request:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/executions/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
```

**Response (running):**

```json
{
  "status": "running"
}
```

**Response (interaction required):**

```json
{
  "status": "interaction_required",
  "interaction_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "prompt": {
    "input_type": "text",
    "text": "Should I include Q4 projections?",
    "placeholder": "Type your response...",
    "required": true,
    "timeout": null,
    "error": null
  },
  "response_url": "/executions/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/interactions/a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890/response"
}
```

The `error` field inside the `prompt` object is only populated when the prompt times out or becomes
unavailable. Under normal operation it is `null`.

**Response (OAuth required):**

```json
{
  "status": "oauth_required",
  "auth_url": "https://provider.example.com/authorize?client_id=...&state=abc123",
  "oauth_state": "abc123"
}
```

**Response (completed):**

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "result": {
    "id": "chatcmpl-abc123",
    "object": "chat.completion",
    "choices": [
      {
        "message": {
          "content": "The analysis is complete. Q4 projections have been included.",
          "role": "assistant"
        },
        "finish_reason": "stop",
        "index": 0
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Response (failed):**

```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "error": "Workflow execution timed out after 300 seconds"
}
```

The following table lists all possible status values:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `running` | The workflow is actively executing |
| `interaction_required` | The workflow is paused waiting for a human response |
| `oauth_required` | The workflow is paused waiting for OAuth2 authorization |
| `completed` | The workflow finished successfully; the `result` field contains the output |
| `failed` | The workflow failed; the `error` field contains the error message |

### Submitting an Interaction Response

When an execution has status `interaction_required`, submit a response to resume the workflow.

- **Route:** `POST /executions/{execution_id}/interactions/{interaction_id}/response`
- **Description:** Submit a human response to a pending interaction prompt.

**Request (text response):**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/executions/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/interactions/a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890/response \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "response": {
      "input_type": "text",
      "text": "Yes, include Q4 projections"
    }
  }'
```

**Response:** `204 No Content`

After submitting a response, the execution transitions back to `running`. Continue polling
`GET /executions/{execution_id}` to track progress.

#### Supported Response Types

The `response` field in the request body is a discriminated union based on `input_type`. All
prompt types supported by [Interactive Workflows](../../build-workflows/advanced/interactive-workflows.md)
are available:

| `input_type` | Fields | Description |
|--------------|--------|-------------|
| `text` | `text` (string) | Free-text response |
| `binary_choice` | `selected_option` (object) | One of two options (for example, Continue or Cancel) |
| `radio` | `selected_option` (object) | Single selection from multiple options |
| `checkbox` | `selected_options` (array of objects) | Multiple selections from a list |
| `dropdown` | `selected_option` (object) | Single selection from a dropdown |
| `notification` | (none) | Acknowledgment of a notification prompt |

**Request (radio response):**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/executions/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/interactions/a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890/response \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "response": {
      "input_type": "radio",
      "selected_option": {"id": "email", "label": "Email", "value": "email"}
    }
  }'
```

**Request (checkbox response):**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/executions/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/interactions/a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890/response \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "response": {
      "input_type": "checkbox",
      "selected_options": [
        {"id": "email", "label": "Email", "value": "email"},
        {"id": "sms", "label": "SMS", "value": "sms"}
      ]
    }
  }'
```

#### Success Responses

| Status Code | Condition |
|-------------|-----------|
| `204` | Response accepted successfully |

#### Error Responses

| Status Code | Condition |
|-------------|-----------|
| `400` | Interaction has already been resolved |
| `404` | Execution or interaction not found |

## Streaming Mode with SSE Events

When using streaming endpoints (`/v1/chat/stream` or `/v1/chat/completions` with `stream: true`),
interactive events are delivered as typed Server-Sent Events within the stream.

### Interaction Required Event

When the workflow pauses for human interaction, the following SSE event is emitted:

```text
event: interaction_required
data: {"event_type": "interaction_required", "execution_id": "550e8400-...", "interaction_id": "a1b2c3d4-...", "prompt": {"input_type": "text", "text": "Should I proceed?", ...}, "response_url": "/executions/550e8400-.../interactions/a1b2c3d4-.../response"}
```

After receiving this event, submit the interaction response through the
`POST /executions/{execution_id}/interactions/{interaction_id}/response` endpoint.
The SSE stream remains open and resumes sending workflow output once the response is submitted.

### OAuth Required Event

When the workflow requires OAuth2 authorization, the following SSE event is emitted:

```text
event: oauth_required
data: {"event_type": "oauth_required", "execution_id": "550e8400-...", "auth_url": "https://provider.example.com/authorize?...", "oauth_state": "abc123"}
```

Direct the user to the `auth_url` to complete authorization. After the OAuth redirect callback
is processed, the stream resumes automatically.

### Client Integration Example

The following Python example demonstrates how to consume the SSE stream and handle interactive events:

```python
import httpx
import json


def stream_with_interactions(base_url: str, messages: list[dict]) -> str:
    """Stream a chat request and handle any interactive events."""
    with httpx.Client(base_url=base_url, timeout=300) as client:
        with client.stream(
            "POST",
            "/v1/chat/stream",
            json={"messages": messages},
        ) as response:
            lines_iter = response.iter_lines()
            for line in lines_iter:
                if not line:
                    continue

                # Check for typed SSE events
                if line.startswith("event: interaction_required"):
                    # Next line is the data payload
                    data_line = next(lines_iter)
                    event = json.loads(data_line.removeprefix("data: "))

                    # Prompt the user
                    print(f"Workflow asks: {event['prompt']['text']}")
                    user_input = input("> ")

                    # Submit the response
                    client.post(
                        event["response_url"],
                        json={
                            "response": {
                                "input_type": "text",
                                "text": user_input,
                            }
                        },
                    )
                    continue

                if line.startswith("event: oauth_required"):
                    data_line = next(lines_iter)
                    event = json.loads(data_line.removeprefix("data: "))
                    print(f"Please authorize at: {event['auth_url']}")
                    input("Press Enter after completing authorization...")
                    continue

                # Regular data chunk
                if line.startswith("data: "):
                    chunk = json.loads(line.removeprefix("data: "))
                    if "value" in chunk:
                        return chunk["value"]

    return ""
```

## OpenAI Chat Completions API Compatibility

The OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`/v1/chat/completions`) also supports interactive extensions when
`enable_interactive_extensions` is `true`. The behavior is the same as for the chat endpoints:

- **Non-streaming** (`stream: false`): Returns `202 Accepted` with execution details when
  interaction or OAuth is required
- **Streaming** (`stream: true`): Emits `interaction_required` or `oauth_required` SSE events
  within the stream

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "nvidia/nemotron-3.5-lightning-30b-a3b",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize my documents"}
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

If the workflow needs human input, the response is `202 Accepted` with the same structure as the
[polling mode responses](#starting-an-execution-polling-mode) described above.

## OAuth2 Flow over HTTP

When a workflow requires OAuth2 authentication (for example, to access a third-party API), the
execution pauses and the authorization URL is surfaced through the execution status or SSE event.

The flow works as follows:

1. The workflow calls an authenticated tool that requires OAuth2
2. The execution status changes to `oauth_required` with the `auth_url`
3. The client directs the user to the `auth_url` to complete authorization
4. The OAuth provider redirects the user to the configured callback path (default: `/auth/redirect`)
5. The callback endpoint exchanges the authorization code for a token and resolves the execution
6. The execution transitions back to `running` and the workflow continues

:::{note}
The OAuth2 callback endpoint must be reachable by the user's browser. Ensure `oauth2_callback_path`
is configured correctly for your deployment environment.
