# NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit API Server Endpoints

There are currently five workflow transactions that can be initiated using HTTP or WebSocket when the NeMo Agent Toolkit server is running: `generate non-streaming`, `generate async`, `generate streaming`, `chat non-streaming`, and `chat streaming`. The following are types of interfaces you can use to interact with your running workflows.
  - **Generate Interface:** Uses the transaction schema defined by your workflow. The interface documentation is accessible
    using Swagger while the server is running [`http://localhost:8000/docs`](http://localhost:8000/docs).
  - **Chat Interface:** [OpenAI API Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text?api-mode=chat) provides
    details on chat formats compatible with the NeMo Agent Toolkit server.

## Default Endpoint Paths

The default endpoint paths use a versioned URL scheme.

:::{note}
Versioned paths are currently experimental due to the added support of HTTP Human-in-the-loop (HITL) and OAuth. They are 1:1 compatible with the legacy endpoints for workflows not relying on those behaviors.
:::

Legacy paths are registered by default for backward compatibility unless explicitly disabled.

| Endpoint | Versioned Path | Legacy Path |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Generate (non-streaming) | `/v1/workflow` | `/generate` |
| Generate (streaming) | `/v1/workflow/stream` | `/generate/stream` |
| Generate (full) | `/v1/workflow/full` | `/generate/full` |
| Generate (async) | `/v1/workflow/async` | `/generate/async` |
| Chat (non-streaming) | `/v1/chat` | `/chat` |
| Chat (streaming) | `/v1/chat/stream` | `/chat/stream` |
| OpenAI v1 Completions | `/v1/chat/completions` | (none) |

### Configuring Legacy Routes

By default, both the versioned and legacy paths are active. You can control this behavior
through the front-end configuration:

```yaml
general:
  front_end:
    _type: fastapi
    workflow:
      path: /v1/workflow
      openai_api_path: /v1/chat
      openai_api_v1_path: /v1/chat/completions
      legacy_path: /generate                  # Optional legacy generate path
      legacy_openai_api_path: /chat           # Optional legacy chat path
    disable_legacy_routes: false              # Set to true to disable legacy paths
```

Setting `disable_legacy_routes` to `true` removes the legacy paths entirely. Set `legacy_path`
or `legacy_openai_api_path` to `null` on individual endpoints to disable specific legacy routes
while keeping others.

### HTTP Interactive Extensions

Interactive workflows (Human-in-the-Loop and OAuth) can be used over plain HTTP without
WebSockets. For details, see [HTTP Interactive Execution](./http-interactive-execution.md).


## Start the NeMo Agent Toolkit Server
This section describes how to start the NeMo Agent Toolkit server.
### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../get-started/quick-start.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key.
```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

Before you use the following examples, ensure that the simple calculator workflow has been installed and is running on http://localhost:8000 by running the following commands:
```bash
uv pip install -e examples/getting_started/simple_calculator
nat serve --config_file examples/getting_started/simple_calculator/configs/config.yml
```

## Generate Non-Streaming Transaction
- **Route:** `/v1/workflow` (legacy: `/generate`)
- **Description:** A non-streaming transaction that waits until all workflow data is available before sending the
result back to the client. The transaction schema is defined by the workflow.
- HTTP Request Example:
  ```bash
  curl --request POST \
    --url http://localhost:8000/v1/workflow \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      "input_message": "Is 4 + 4 greater than the current hour of the day"
    }'
  ```
- **HTTP Response Example:** (actual response will vary based on the time of day)
  ```json
  {
    "value":"No, 4 + 4 is not greater than the current hour of the day."
  }
  ```

## Asynchronous Generate
The asynchronous generate endpoint allows clients to submit a workflow to run in the background and return a response immediately with a unique identifier for the workflow. This can be used to query the status and results of the workflow at a later time. This is useful for long-running workflows, which would otherwise cause the client to time out.

This endpoint is only available when the `async_endpoints` optional dependency extra is installed. For users installing from source, this can be done by running `uv pip install -e ".[async_endpoints]"` from the root directory of the NeMo Agent Toolkit library. Similarly, for users installing from PyPI, this can be done by running `pip install "nvidia-nat[async_endpoints]"`.

Asynchronous jobs are managed using [Dask](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/). By default, a local Dask cluster is created at start time, however you can also configure the server to connect to an existing Dask scheduler by setting the `scheduler_address` configuration parameter. The Dask scheduler is used to manage the execution of asynchronous jobs, and can be configured to run on a single machine or across a cluster of machines. Job history and metadata is stored in a SQL database using [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/). By default, a temporary SQLite database is created at start time, however you can also configure the server to use a persistent database by setting the `db_url` configuration parameter. Refer to the [SQLAlchemy documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html#database-urls) for the format of the `db_url` parameter. Any database supported by [SQLAlchemy's Asynchronous I/O extension](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/extensions/asyncio.html) can be used. Refer to [SQLAlchemy's Dialects](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/dialects/index.html) for a complete list (many but not all of these support Asynchronous I/O).

### Asynchronous Specific CLI Flags
The following CLI flags are available to configure the asynchronous generate endpoint when using `nat serve`:
* `--dask_log_level`: The logging level for Dask. Default is `WARNING`.
* `--dask_threads_per_worker`: The number of threads to use per Dask worker. Default is `1`. When set to `0` the value uses the Dask default. This is only used when `scheduler_address` is not set.
* `--dask_workers`: The type of Dask workers to use. Options are `threads` for Threaded Dask workers or `processes` for Process based Dask workers. Default is `processes`. This is only used when `scheduler_address` is not set.
* `--dask_worker_memory_limit`: The memory limit for each Dask worker. Can be 'auto', a memory string like '4GB', or a float representing a fraction of the system memory. The default value is '0', which means there is no memory limit. Refer to https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/deploying-python.html#reference for details.
* `--db_url`: The [SQLAlchemy database](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html#database-urls) URL to use for storing job history and metadata. If not set, a temporary SQLite database will be created.
* `--max_concurrent_jobs`: Maximum number of Dask workers to create for running async jobs. The name of this parameter is misleading as the actual number of concurrent async jobs is: `max_running_async_jobs * dask_threads_per_worker`. Default is 10. This is only used when `scheduler_address` is not set.
* `--scheduler_address`: The address of an existing Dask scheduler to connect to. If not set, a local Dask cluster will be created.

### Database Connection Pooling
Deployments backed by a network-attached database, such as a managed PostgreSQL instance, can have idle pooled connections closed by the database server or by intervening infrastructure. The client is not notified, so the next request to check out a stale connection fails before the pool replaces it. The following environment variables configure the [SQLAlchemy connection pool](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/pooling.html) used for job history and metadata. They apply to every process that inherits them, which covers the API server workers and the workers of a local Dask cluster created at start time. Workers belonging to a Dask scheduler you run separately need these variables set in their own environment:
* `NAT_JOB_STORE_POOL_PRE_PING`: When set to `1`, `true`, `yes`, or `on`, each pooled connection is tested with a lightweight query before use, and stale connections are transparently replaced. Set to `0`, `false`, `no`, or `off` to disable. Unset by default, which leaves the SQLAlchemy default of disabled.
* `NAT_JOB_STORE_POOL_RECYCLE`: The maximum age in seconds of a pooled connection before it is discarded and reopened. Set this below the idle timeout enforced by your database or network infrastructure. Unset by default, which leaves the SQLAlchemy default of `-1`, meaning connections are never recycled.

Setting `NAT_JOB_STORE_POOL_PRE_PING` to `true` is the usual remedy when the first asynchronous job submitted after an idle period fails with a closed connection error. Explicit `pool_pre_ping` and `pool_recycle` keyword arguments passed to `get_db_engine` take precedence over these variables.

### Endpoint Details

- **Route:** `/v1/workflow/async` (legacy: `/generate/async`)
- **Description:** A non-streaming transaction that submits a workflow to run in the background.
- **Optional Fields:**
  - `job_id`: A unique identifier for the job. If not provided, a UUID will be generated. It can be any string value. However, it is the caller's responsibility to ensure uniqueness. If `job_id` already exists, the server will return the latest status for that job.
  - `sync_timeout`: The maximum time in seconds to wait for the job to complete before returning a response. If the job completes in less than `sync_timeout` seconds then the response will include the job result, otherwise the `job_id` and `status` is returned. The default is `0`, which causes the request to return immediately, and maximum value for this field is `300`.
  - `expiry_seconds`: The amount of time in seconds after the job completes (either successfully or unsuccessfully), which any output files will be preserved before being deleted. Default is `3600` (1 hours), minimum value is `600` (10 minutes) and maximum value for this field is `86400` (24 hours). The text output in the response is not affected by this field.

### Example Request and Response
- HTTP Request Example:
  ```bash
  curl --request POST \
    --url http://localhost:8000/v1/workflow/async \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

      "input_message": "Is 4 + 4 greater than the current hour of the day"
    }'
  ```
- **HTTP Response Example:**
  ```json

## Generate Streaming Transaction
  - **Route:** `/v1/workflow/stream` (legacy: `/generate/stream`)
  - **Description:** A streaming transaction that allows data to be sent in chunks as it becomes available from the
    workflow, rather than waiting for the complete response to be available.
- HTTP Request Example:
  ```bash
  curl --request POST \
    --url http://localhost:8000/v1/workflow/stream \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      "input_message": "Is 4 + 4 greater than the current hour of the day"
    }'
  ```

  ```json
  "data": { "value": "No, 4 + 4 (which is 8) is not greater than the current hour of the day (which is 15)." }
  ```
## Generate Streaming Full Transaction
  - **Route:** `/v1/workflow/full` (legacy: `/generate/full`)
  - **Description:** Same as `/v1/workflow/stream` but provides raw `IntermediateStep` objects
    without any step adaptor translations. Use the `filter_steps` query parameter to filter
    steps by type (comma-separated list) or set to 'none' to suppress all intermediate steps.
  - **HTTP Request Example:**
    ```bash
    curl --request POST \
    --url http://localhost:8000/v1/workflow/full \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      "input_message": "Is 4 + 4 greater than the current hour of the day"
    }'
    ```

  "data": {"value":"No, 4 + 4 (which is 8) is not greater than the current hour of the day (which is 11)."}
  ```
- **HTTP Request Example with Filter:**
  By default, all intermediate steps are streamed. Use the `filter_steps` query parameter to filter steps by type (comma-separated list) or set to `none` to suppress all intermediate steps.

  Suppress all intermediate steps (only get final output):
  ```bash
  curl --request POST \
    --url 'http://localhost:8000/v1/workflow/full?filter_steps=none' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{"input_message": "Is 4 + 4 greater than the current hour of the day"}'
  ```
  Get only specific step types:
  ```bash
  curl --request POST \
    --url 'http://localhost:8000/v1/workflow/full?filter_steps=LLM_END,TOOL_END' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

## OpenAI Chat Completions API Compatible Endpoint

The NeMo Agent Toolkit provides full OpenAI Chat Completions API compatibility through a dedicated endpoint that enables seamless integration with existing OpenAI-compatible client libraries and workflows.

### Overview

When the OpenAI v1 compatible endpoint is configured, the toolkit creates a single endpoint that fully implements the [OpenAI Chat Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) specification. This endpoint handles both streaming and non-streaming requests based on the `stream` parameter, exactly like the official OpenAI API.

#### Key Benefits

- **Drop-in Replacement**: Works with existing OpenAI client libraries without code changes
- **Full API Compatibility**: Supports all OpenAI Chat Completions API parameters
- **Industry Standard**: Familiar interface for developers already using OpenAI
- **Future-Proof**: Aligned with established API patterns and ecosystem tools

### Configuration

To enable the OpenAI v1 compatible endpoint, set `openai_api_v1_path` in your FastAPI front-end configuration:

```yaml
general:
  front_end:
    _type: fastapi
    workflow:
      method: POST
      openai_api_v1_path: /v1/chat/completions
```

#### Configuration Options

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `path` | string | `/v1/workflow` | Path for the generate endpoint |
| `openai_api_path` | string | `/v1/chat` | Path for the OpenAI chat endpoint |
| `openai_api_v1_path` | string | `/v1/chat/completions` | Path for the OpenAI v1 compatible endpoint |
| `legacy_path` | string or null | `/generate` | Legacy path for the generate endpoint. Set to `null` to disable |
| `legacy_openai_api_path` | string or null | `/chat` | Legacy path for the chat endpoint. Set to `null` to disable |
| `method` | string | `POST` | HTTP method for the endpoint |
| `disable_legacy_routes` | boolean | `false` | Disable all legacy routes globally |
| `enable_interactive_extensions` | boolean | `false` | Enable [HTTP interactive execution](./http-interactive-execution.md) on OpenAI Chat Completions endpoint |

### Endpoint Behavior

#### OpenAI v1 Compatible Mode (`openai_api_v1_path` configured)

Creates a single endpoint that handles both streaming and non-streaming requests:

- **Route**: `/v1/chat/completions` (configurable via `openai_api_v1_path`)
- **Method**: POST
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`
- **Behavior**: Routes to streaming or non-streaming based on `stream` parameter

#### Legacy Mode (`openai_api_v1_path` not configured)

Creates separate endpoints for different request types:

- **Non-streaming**: `/<openai_api_path>`
- **Streaming**: `<openai_api_path>/stream`

### Request Format

The endpoint accepts all standard OpenAI Chat Completions API parameters:

  }'
```

#### Client Library Examples

**OpenAI Python Client:**

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize client pointing to your NeMo Agent Toolkit server
client = OpenAI(
    api_key="not-needed",  # API key not required for local deployment
    base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1"
)

# Non-streaming chat completion
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="nvidia/nemotron-3.5-lightning-30b-a3b",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"}
    ],
    stream=False,
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=150
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

**AI SDK (JavaScript/TypeScript):**

```typescript
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

// Configure custom OpenAI provider
const customOpenAI = openai({
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:8000/v1',
  apiKey: 'not-needed'
});

// Non-streaming generation
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: customOpenAI('nvidia/nemotron-3.5-lightning-30b-a3b'),
  prompt: 'Explain the benefits of renewable energy',
  temperature: 0.7,
  maxTokens: 200
});

console.log(text);
```

### Migration Guide

#### From Legacy Paths to Versioned Paths

The default endpoint paths have been updated to use a versioned URL scheme. Legacy paths
(`/generate`, `/chat`) continue to work by default. To migrate:

1. **Update client URLs**: Replace `/generate` with `/v1/workflow` and `/chat` with `/v1/chat`
2. **Update streaming URLs**: Replace `/generate/stream` with `/v1/workflow/stream` and `/chat/stream` with `/v1/chat/stream`
3. **Test thoroughly**: Verify all endpoints work with the new paths
4. **Disable legacy routes** (optional): Set `disable_legacy_routes: true` in your configuration once all clients have been migrated

#### From Legacy Chat Mode to OpenAI v1 Compatible Mode

If you are currently using legacy mode with separate endpoints:

1. **Update Configuration**: Set `openai_api_v1_path: /v1/chat/completions`
2. **Update Client Code**: Use the single endpoint with a `stream` parameter
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify both streaming and non-streaming functionality

#### From OpenAI API

If you are migrating from the OpenAI API:

1. **Update Base URL**: Point to your NeMo Agent Toolkit server
2. **Update Model Names**: Use your configured model identifiers
3. **Test Compatibility**: Verify all features work as expected

## Feedback Endpoint
- **Route:** `/feedback`
- **Description:** Add reaction feedback for an assistant message through observability trace ID. This endpoint is available when using the Weave FastAPI plugin worker. For setup instructions, see the [Weave observability guide](../../run-workflows/observe/observe-workflow-with-weave.md#user-feedback-integration).
- **HTTP Request Example:**
  ```bash
  curl --request POST \
    --url http://localhost:8000/feedback \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
      "observability_trace_id": "01933b2e-1234-5678-9abc-def012345678",
      "reaction_type": "👍"
    }'
  ```
- **HTTP Response Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Added reaction '👍' to call 01933b2e-1234-5678-9abc-def012345678"
  }
  ```

## Per-User Workflow Monitoring Endpoint

The NeMo Agent Toolkit provides a built-in monitoring endpoint for per-user workflows that exposes real-time resource usage metrics. This is useful for debugging, capacity planning, and operational monitoring of multi-user deployments.

### Configuration

To enable the monitoring endpoint, set `enable_per_user_monitoring` to `true` in your workflow configuration:

```yaml
general:
  enable_per_user_monitoring: true
```

:::{note}
This endpoint is only available when:
- The workflow is registered as a per-user workflow (using `@register_per_user_function`)
- The `enable_per_user_monitoring` configuration option is set to `true`
:::

### Endpoint Details

- **Route:** `/monitor/users`
- **Method:** GET
- **Description:** Returns resource usage metrics for all active per-user workflow sessions, or for a specific user if a `user_id` query parameter is provided.

- **Usage Analytics**: Track LLM token consumption and request volumes per user
- **Session Management**: Identify inactive sessions for cleanup or investigate active sessions

### Related Documentation

For more information about per-user workflows, refer to:
- [Writing Per-User Functions](../../extend/custom-components/custom-functions/per-user-functions.md)

## Evaluation Endpoint
You can also evaluate workflows via the NeMo Agent Toolkit `evaluate` endpoint. The endpoint is registered by the core FastAPI worker and enabled only when `nvidia-nat-eval` is installed (plus `async_endpoints` support for async job handling). For more information, refer to the [NeMo Agent Toolkit Evaluation Endpoint](./evaluate-api.md) documentation.

## Choosing between Streaming and Non-Streaming
Use streaming if you need real-time updates or live communication where users expect immediate feedback. Use non-streaming if your workflow responds with simple updates and less feedback is needed.

## NeMo Agent Toolkit API Server Interaction Guide
A custom user interface can communicate with the API server using both HTTP requests and WebSocket connections.

- For details on proper WebSocket messaging integration, refer to the [WebSocket Messaging Interface](./websockets.md) documentation.
- For HTTP-based interactive workflows (Human-in-the-Loop and OAuth without WebSockets), refer to the [HTTP Interactive Execution](./http-interactive-execution.md) documentation.
