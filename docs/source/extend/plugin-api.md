# NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit — Public Plugin API

NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit external plugin packages should import plugin-authoring APIs from `nat.plugin_api`.
This module is the stable public import surface for registering common plugin components and authoring functions or
function groups.

```python
from nat.plugin_api import Builder
from nat.plugin_api import FunctionGroup
from nat.plugin_api import FunctionGroupBaseConfig
from nat.plugin_api import SerializableSecretStr
from nat.plugin_api import register_function_group
```

## Public Surface

The following `nat.plugin_api` exports are intended for plugin authors:

- Registration decorators for common external plugin components, such as `register_function`,
  `register_function_group`, `register_llm_provider`, `register_embedder_provider`, `register_retriever_provider`,
  `register_memory`, `register_object_store`, `register_middleware`, `register_telemetry_exporter`, and
  `register_tool_wrapper`.
- Function authoring types, including `Builder`, `EvalBuilder`, `Function`, `FunctionInfo`, and `FunctionGroup`.
- Component configuration bases, including `FunctionBaseConfig`, `FunctionGroupBaseConfig`, `LLMBaseConfig`,
  `EmbedderBaseConfig`, `RetrieverBaseConfig`, `MemoryBaseConfig`, `ObjectStoreBaseConfig`,
  `MiddlewareBaseConfig`, `FunctionMiddlewareBaseConfig`, `DynamicMiddlewareConfig`, `EvaluatorBaseConfig`,
  `EvalDatasetBaseConfig`, and `TelemetryExporterBaseConfig`.
- Registration return helpers, including `LLMProviderInfo`, `EmbedderProviderInfo`, `RetrieverProviderInfo`,
  `EvaluatorInfo`, and `DatasetLoaderInfo`.
- Small implementation contracts needed by registered components, including `FunctionMiddleware`,
  `DynamicFunctionMiddleware`, `CircuitBreakerMiddleware`, `CircuitBreakerMiddlewareConfig`,
  `CircuitBreakerOpenError`, `CircuitBreakerState`, `HITLMiddleware`, `HITLMiddlewareConfig`, `InvocationAction`,
  `MemoryEditor`, `ObjectStore`, `Retriever`, `Document`, `RetrieverOutput`, and their associated context
  or value models. The interactive data models that HITL middleware hooks and user-input callbacks produce
  and receive are also included: `HumanPrompt`, `InteractionPrompt`, `InteractionResponse`, the
  `HumanResponse` union, and the concrete response models `HumanResponseText`, `HumanResponseBinary`,
  `HumanResponseNotification`, `HumanResponseRadio`, `HumanResponseCheckbox`, and `HumanResponseDropdown`.
  The concrete prompt content models behind the `HumanPrompt` union are included as well: `HumanPromptText`,
  `HumanPromptNotification`, `HumanPromptBinary`, `HumanPromptRadio`, `HumanPromptCheckbox`, and
  `HumanPromptDropdown`, together with the `BinaryHumanPromptOption` and `MultipleChoiceOption` models that
  binary and multiple-choice prompts and responses embed.
- Runtime context access through `Context` and `ContextState`, for reading invocation-scoped state
  such as `workflow_run_id`, `user_id`, and the active function, and for prompting users through
  `Context.get().user_interaction_manager`.
- Component reference types, such as `FunctionRef`, `FunctionGroupRef`, `LLMRef`, `EmbedderRef`, `RetrieverRef`,
  `MemoryRef`, `ObjectStoreRef`, and `MiddlewareRef`.
- Framework wrapper identifiers, including `LLMFrameworkEnum`.
- Secret helpers, including `SerializableSecretStr`, `OptionalSecretStr`, `get_secret_value`, and `set_secret_from_env`.

When a symbol is exported from `nat.plugin_api` and marked stable in the surface review below, external packages can
depend on that symbol's documented behavior across minor and patch releases. Breaking changes to stable public surfaces
require a major release. Symbols marked provisional are available for plugin authors, but their compatibility contract is
still being refined and may evolve before being promoted to stable public status.

Installed plugins execute as trusted Python code in the application environment. This public facade defines stable import
paths and authoring contracts; it does not make untrusted plugin packages safe to install or execute.

The contract is intentionally explicit: adding a new public symbol requires adding it to `nat.plugin_api.__all__`, the
public API export test, and this documentation. Symbols that are not exported from `nat.plugin_api` should be treated as
implementation details unless a subsystem guide explicitly documents them as a specialized extension interface. Larger
subsystem-specific pipelines, such as telemetry processors or finetuning runtime interfaces, remain in their owning
modules until those contracts are promoted deliberately.

## Surface Review

The public facade is intentionally narrower than every component type supported by the runtime. The table below records
the current promotion decision for the major plugin-authoring surfaces.

| Area | Public API status | Motivation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Functions | Stable public | Core external plugin unit. Third-party tool and workflow packages need `register_function`, `FunctionBaseConfig`, `FunctionInfo`, and `Builder`. |
| Function groups | Stable public | Best fit for providers exposing multiple related tools. Supports external packages that share clients and resources and expose `group__function` names. |
| Builder type and common component access | Stable public | Registered build functions receive a builder. Authors need a stable builder type without depending on `WorkflowBuilder`. Only the builder methods categorized as stable in `packages/nvidia_nat_core/tests/nat/test_plugin_api.py` are part of the facade contract; deferred subsystem methods and concrete builders remain implementation details. |
| Configuration bases | Stable public except where a component row below is provisional or deferred | Public decorators require corresponding configuration base classes for typed YAML and discovery contracts. A component's configuration base follows that component's support tier. |
| Provider info objects | Stable public | LLM, embedder, retriever, dataset, and evaluator registrations yield these helper objects. |
| Component refs | Stable public | External configurations need stable references to configured functions, LLMs, embedders, retrievers, memory, object stores, and middleware. |
| Secrets | Stable public | External providers commonly need API keys and environment-backed secrets. Public helpers reduce raw-string credential patterns. |
| Registration decorators | Stable public except where a component row below is provisional or deferred | Decorators are the core plugin discovery and registration API. A component's registration decorator follows that component's support tier. |
| LLM registration and clients | Stable public | External LLM providers and framework clients are primary integration points. The stable facade covers registration, configuration, provider metadata, refs, and framework wrapper identifiers. Framework-native client runtime types and optional provider-specific config mixins remain framework or subsystem APIs unless exported from `nat.plugin_api`. |
| Embedder registration and clients | Stable public | External embedding providers and framework clients are expected provider plugins. The stable facade covers registration, configuration, provider metadata, refs, and wrapper selection. Framework-native client runtime types remain framework-specific. |
| Retriever | Stable public | External retrieval providers and framework clients are expected provider plugins. The stable facade includes retriever registration, configuration, provider metadata, refs, and the native retriever contract types `Retriever`, `RetrieverOutput`, and `Document`. |
| Evaluator and dataset loader registration | Stable public | Evaluation integrations and dataset loaders are documented plugin types with direct external authoring use cases. The stable facade covers registration, configuration, and info objects. Evaluator helper classes and ATIF-specific evaluator models remain subsystem-specific until promoted deliberately. |
| Evaluation callback registration | Provisional public | The facade exposes `register_eval_callback` for telemetry integrations that need evaluation lifecycle hooks. Callback protocol and result model types remain eval subsystem APIs and may evolve until they are promoted deliberately. |
| Memory | Stable public, trusted plugin | External memory backends are documented integration points. They may handle user data, so plugins must be trusted. |
| Object store | Stable public, trusted plugin | External storage backends need the config base, object-store interface, item model, and standard errors. Plugins must be trusted. |
| Middleware registration and function middleware | Stable public, trusted plugin | Basic middleware registration and function middleware support caching, policy, auth injection, redaction, and tracing. Middleware can observe or alter calls, so plugins must be trusted. |
| Dynamic middleware and runtime introspection | Provisional public, trusted plugin | Dynamic middleware reaches deeper into runtime call interception and inventory metadata. The facade exposes the current dynamic middleware types, but inventory and unregister details remain subsystem-specific until the contract is promoted deliberately. |
| HITL middleware | Provisional public, trusted plugin | HITL middleware is an abstract extension point for human-in-the-loop function interception. The facade exposes `HITLMiddleware`, `HITLMiddlewareConfig`, `InvocationAction`, and the interactive data models `HumanPrompt`, `InteractionPrompt`, `InteractionResponse`, and `HumanResponse` with the concrete prompt content, response, and choice-option models behind both unions so that concrete subclass authors and user-input integrations can import the full authoring and interactive-model surface from `nat.plugin_api`. |
| Runtime context access | Provisional public | Middleware, HITL, and telemetry integrations read invocation-scoped state (for example `workflow_run_id`, `user_id`, and the active function) and prompt users through `Context.get().user_interaction_manager`. The facade exposes `Context` and `ContextState`. Deeper runtime wiring such as intermediate-step manager internals and exporter management remains subsystem-specific until promoted deliberately. |
| Telemetry registration | Provisional public, trusted plugin | The facade currently exposes telemetry exporter registration and configuration. Exporter implementation APIs, including raw exporters, span exporters, processors, and intermediate-step models, remain subsystem-specific and may evolve until they are promoted deliberately. Telemetry plugins can observe sensitive workflow data and must be trusted. |
| Tool wrapper registration | Provisional public | The facade exposes `register_tool_wrapper` for framework integrations. Wrapper callables depend on framework-native tool types and currently return framework-specific objects, so keep this provisional until the wrapper callable contract is promoted deliberately. |
| Auth provider | Deferred | Authentication provider authoring is still experimental and depends on subsystem APIs such as `AuthProviderBase`, `AuthProviderBaseConfig`, `AuthenticationRef`, and `register_auth_provider`. Keep it out of the stable facade until the auth compatibility and trust contract is promoted deliberately. |
| Front end | Deferred | Runtime hosting surfaces need a more explicit compatibility and security contract before being promoted through `nat.plugin_api`. |
| Logging | Deferred | External log sinks may export sensitive logs. Keep the existing implementation API until the stable contract and trust guidance are clearer. |
| Registry handler | Deferred | Registry handlers influence component discovery and resolution. Keep out of the stable facade until that extension contract is reviewed. |
| Optimizer and optimizer callback | Deferred | Optimizer extension points are specialized subsystem APIs and are not required by common integration packages. |
| Trainer, trainer adapter, and trajectory builder | Deferred | Finetuning extensions are broad subsystem APIs. Keep them in owning modules until the finetuning compatibility contract is promoted deliberately. |
| TTC strategy | Deferred | Test-time compute is an advanced and experimental subsystem. Do not imply stable public facade support until that API matures. |

Deferred surfaces remain available through their existing modules where those subsystem guides document them, but they are
not part of the stable `nat.plugin_api` facade. The deferred candidate list is also captured in
`packages/nvidia_nat_core/tests/nat/test_plugin_api.py` so CI can catch accidental promotion or stale candidate paths.

## Private Implementation Modules

Implementation modules remain importable for backward compatibility, but external plugin packages should not treat them
as stable API contracts. Prefer `nat.plugin_api` over direct imports from modules such as:

- `nat.cli.register_workflow`
- `nat.cli.type_registry`
- `nat.builder.function`
- `nat.builder.function_base`
- `nat.builder.function_info`
- `nat.builder.workflow_builder`

Concrete builders such as `WorkflowBuilder` are runtime implementation details. Plugin builders should type against
`Builder`, and plugin tests should use the utilities in `nvidia-nat-test` where possible.

## Function Group Contract

Function groups are the preferred pattern when one external service exposes multiple related tools. A function group:

- Shares one configuration object across all functions in the group.
- Can share clients, connections, caches, and other resources.
- Exposes functions using `instance_name__function_name`.
- Supports `include` and `exclude` fields from `FunctionGroupBaseConfig` to control which functions are exposed through
  workflow tool references.

```python
class SearchConfig(FunctionGroupBaseConfig, name="search_provider"):
    api_key: SerializableSecretStr


@register_function_group(config_type=SearchConfig)
async def build_search(config: SearchConfig, _builder: Builder):
    group = FunctionGroup(config=config, instance_name="search")

    async def search(query: str) -> dict:
        ...

    group.add_function("search", search, description=search.__doc__)
    yield group
```

With this group configured as `search`, the function name is `search__search`.
