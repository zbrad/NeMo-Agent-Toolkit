# About Building NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit Workflows

In NeMo Agent Toolkit, a workflow defines which [functions](./functions-and-function-groups/functions.md) and [models](./llms/index.md) are used to perform a given task or series of tasks. A workflow definition is specified in a [YAML configuration file](#understanding-the-workflow-configuration-file). The `workflow` section of the configuration file defines the workflow itself, and specifies a function, typically an [agent](../components/agents/index.md), which will orchestrate which functions and models are called to complete the given task.

## Workflow Overview

### Understanding the Workflow Configuration File

The workflow configuration file is a YAML file that specifies the [tools](./functions-and-function-groups/functions.md#agents-and-tools) and models to use in a workflow, along with general configuration settings. This section examines the configuration of the `examples/getting_started/simple_web_query` workflow to show how they are organized.

`examples/getting_started/simple_web_query/configs/config.yml`:

```yaml
functions:
  webpage_query:
    _type: webpage_query
    webpage_url: https://docs.smith.langchain.com
    description: "Search for information about LangSmith. For any questions about LangSmith, you must use this tool!"
    embedder_name: nemotron-3-embed-1b
    chunk_size: 512
  current_datetime:
    _type: current_datetime

llms:
  nim_llm:
    _type: nim
    model_name: nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b
    temperature: 0.0

embedders:
  nemotron-3-embed-1b:
    _type: nim
    model_name: nvidia/nemotron-3-embed-1b

workflow:
  _type: react_agent
  tool_names: [webpage_query, current_datetime]
  llm_name: nim_llm
  verbose: true
  parse_agent_response_max_retries: 3
```

This workflow configuration is divided into four sections: `functions`, `llms`, `embedders`, and `workflow`. The `functions` section contains the tools used in the workflow, while `llms` and `embedders` define the models used in the workflow, and lastly the `workflow` section ties the other sections together and defines the workflow itself.

#### The `functions` Section

In this workflow, the `webpage_query` tool queries the LangSmith User Guide, and the `current_datetime` tool gets the current date and time. The `description` entry instructs the LLM when and how to use the tool. In this case, the workflow explicitly defines `description` for the `webpage_query` tool.

#### The `llms` and `embedders` Sections

The `webpage_query` tool uses the `nemotron-3-embed-1b` embedder, which is defined in the `embedders` section.

#### The `workflow` Section

The workflow itself is typically an agent, however any NeMo Agent Toolkit function can be used as a workflow. Refer to the [Agents](../components/agents/index.md) documentation for more details on the agents that are included in NeMo Agent Toolkit.

For details on workflow configuration, including sections not utilized in the above example, refer to the [Workflow Configuration](./workflow-configuration.md) document.

## Key Concepts

Understanding these concepts will help you build workflows effectively.

### Workflow

A workflow defines which functions and models are used to perform a given task or series of tasks. The `workflow` section of the configuration file defines the workflow itself, and specifies a function, typically an agent, which will orchestrate which functions and models are called to complete the given task.

### Configuration File

A workflow definition is specified in a YAML configuration file. The file specifies the tools and models to use in a workflow, along with general configuration settings, organized into the `functions`, `llms`, `embedders`, and `workflow` sections.

### Functions (Tools)

The `functions` section contains the tools used in the workflow. The `description` entry instructs the LLM when and how to use the tool.

### Agents

The workflow itself is typically an agent, however any NeMo Agent Toolkit function can be used as a workflow. Refer to the [Agents](../components/agents/index.md) documentation for more details on the agents that are included in NeMo Agent Toolkit.

### Control Flow Components

Control flow components are offered by NeMo Agent Toolkit to direct how a workflow runs, including the [Router Agent](../components/agents/router-agent/index.md) and the [Sequential Executor](../components/agents/sequential-executor/index.md).

## Common Approaches

The following are [agents](../components/agents/index.md) offered by NeMo Agent Toolkit. Choose the approach that best fits your needs.

- [Automatic Memory Wrapper Agent](../components/agents/auto-memory-wrapper/index.md) — Wraps any agent to provide automatic memory capture and retrieval without requiring the LLM to invoke memory tools explicitly.
- [ReAct Agent](../components/agents/react-agent/index.md) — Performs ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) reasoning between tool calls.
- [Reasoning Agent](../components/agents/reasoning-agent/index.md) — Reasons ahead of time through planning rather than between steps (requires an LLM that supports reasoning).
- [ReWOO Agent](../components/agents/rewoo-agent/index.md) — Decouples reasoning from observations to improve tool usage and token efficiency for reasoning tasks.
- [Responses API and Agent](../components/agents/responses-api-and-agent/index.md) — Use tool with OpenAI's Responses API, including built-in tools, MCP remote tools, and NeMo Agent Toolkit tools.
- [Tool Calling Agent](../components/agents/tool-calling-agent/index.md) — Directly invokes external tools based on structured function definitions (requires an LLM with tool-calling support).

## Decision Factors

The following are control flow components offered by NeMo Agent Toolkit. Use the following comparison to select the right component.

| Factor | [Router Agent](../components/agents/router-agent/index.md) | [Sequential Executor](../components/agents/sequential-executor/index.md) |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **What it does** | Analyzes incoming requests and directs them to the most appropriate branch based on the request configuration. | Chains multiple functions together, where each function's output becomes the input for the next function. |
| **How it runs** | Pairs a single-pass architecture with intelligent request routing to analyze prompts and select one branch that best handles the request. | Creates a linear tool execution pipeline that executes functions in a predetermined sequence without requiring LLMs or agents for orchestration. |
| **Best For** | Scenarios where different types of requests need specialized handling. | Linear pipelines where each function feeds the next; supports better error handling and optional compatibility validation. |
