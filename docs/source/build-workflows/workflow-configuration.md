# Workflow Configuration

NeMo Agent Toolkit [workflows](./about-building-workflows.md) are defined by a [YAML configuration file](#workflow-configuration-file), which specifies which entities ([functions](./functions-and-function-groups/functions.md), [LLMs](./llms/index.md), [embedders](./embedders.md), etc.) to use in the workflow, along with general configuration settings.

The configuration attributes of each entity in NeMo Agent Toolkit is defined by a [Configuration Object](#configuration-object). This object defines both the type and optionally the default value of each attribute. Any attribute without a default value is required to be specified in the configuration file.

## Configuration Object
Each NeMo Agent Toolkit [function](./functions-and-function-groups/functions.md) requires a configuration object that inherits from {py:class}`~nat.data_models.function.FunctionBaseConfig`. The `FunctionBaseConfig` class and ultimately all NeMo Agent Toolkit configuration objects are subclasses of the [`pydantic.BaseModel`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.11/api/base_model/#pydantic.BaseModel) class from the [Pydantic Library](https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.11/), which provides a way to define and validate configuration objects. Each configuration object defines the parameters used to create runtime instances of functions (or other component type), each with different functionality based on configuration settings. It is possible to define nested functions that access other component runtime instances by name. These could be other `functions`, `llms`, `embedders`, `retrievers`, or `memory`. To facilitate nested runtime instance discovery, each component must be initialized in order based on the dependency tree. Enabling this feature requires configuration object parameters that refer to other component instances by name use a `ComponentRef` `dtype` that matches referred component type. The supported `ComponentRef` types are enumerated below:

- `FunctionRef`: Refers to a registered [function](./functions-and-function-groups/functions.md) by its instance name in the `functions` section configuration object.
- `LLMRef`: Refers to a registered [LLM](./llms/index.md) by its instance name in the `llms` section of the configuration object.
- `EmbedderRef`: Refers to a registered [embedder](./embedders.md) by its instance name in the `embedders` section of the configuration object.
- `RetrieverRef`: Refers to a registered [retriever](./retrievers.md) by its instance name in the `retrievers` section of the configuration object.
- `MemoryRef`: Refers to a registered [memory](./memory.md) by its instance name in the `memory` section of the configuration object.


## Workflow Configuration File

The workflow configuration file is a YAML file that specifies the tools and models to use in the workflow, along with general configuration settings. To illustrate how these are organized, we will examine the configuration of the simple workflow.

`examples/getting_started/simple_web_query/configs/config.yml`:
```yaml
functions:
  webpage_query:
    _type: webpage_query
    webpage_url: https://docs.smith.langchain.com
    description: "Search for information about LangSmith. For any questions about LangSmith, you must use this tool!"
    embedder_name: nemotron-3-embed-1b
    chunk_size: 512
  current_datetime:
    _type: current_datetime

llms:
  nim_llm:
    _type: nim
    model_name: nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b
    temperature: 0.0

embedders:
  nemotron-3-embed-1b:
    _type: nim
    model_name: nvidia/nemotron-3-embed-1b

workflow:
  _type: react_agent
  tool_names: [webpage_query, current_datetime]
  llm_name: nim_llm
  verbose: true
  parse_agent_response_max_retries: 3
```

From the above we see that it is divided into four sections: `functions`, `llms`, `embedders`, and `workflow`. There are additional optional sections not used in the above example they are: `general`, `memory`, `retrievers`, and `eval`.

### `functions`
The `functions` section contains the tools used in the workflow, in our example we have two `webpage_query` and `current_datetime`. By convention, the key matches the `_type` value, however this is not a strict requirement, and can be used to include multiple instances of the same tool.


### `llms`
This section contains the models used in the workflow. The `_type` value refers to the API hosting the model, in this case `nim` refers to an NIM model hosted on [`build.nvidia.com`](https://build.nvidia.com).

<!-- path-check-skip-next-line -->
The `model_name` value needs to match a model hosted by the API. In this example, we use the [`nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b`](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b) model.

Each type of API supports specific attributes. For `nim` these are defined in the {py:class}`~nat.llm.nim_llm.NIMModelConfig` class.

See the [LLMs](./llms/index.md) documentation for more information.

### `embedders`
<!-- path-check-skip-next-line -->
This section follows a the same structure as the `llms` section and serves as a way to separate the embedding models from the LLM models. In our example, we are using the [`nvidia/nemotron-3-embed-1b`](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemotron-3-embed-1b) model.

See the [Embedders](./embedders.md) documentation for more information.

### `workflow`

This section ties the previous sections together by defining the tools and LLM models to use. The `tool_names` section lists the tool names from the `functions` section, while the `llm_name` section specifies the LLM model to use.

The `_type` value refers to the workflow type, in our example we are using a `react_agent` workflow. While the choice of workflow type is commonly an [agent](../components/agents/index.md), this can be any registered NeMo Agent Toolkit function.

:::{note}
In NeMo Agent Toolkit, an agent is a special type of function.
:::

The parameters for the `react_agent` workflow are specified by the {py:class}`~nat.plugins.langchain.agent.react_agent.register.ReActAgentWorkflowConfig` class.

### `general`
This section contains general configuration settings for NeMo Agent Toolkit which are not specific to any workflow. The parameters for this section are specified by the {py:class}`~nat.data_models.config.GeneralConfig` class.

:::{note}
⚠️ **Deprecated**: The `use_uvloop` parameter is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Previously, the `use_uvloop` parameter meant to specify whether to use the [`uvloop`](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop) event loop, but now the use of `uv_loop` will be automatically determined based on the system platform the user is using.
:::

### `eval`
This section contains the evaluation settings for the workflow. Refer to [Evaluating NeMo Agent Toolkit Workflows](../improve-workflows/evaluate.md) for more information.

### `memory`

This section configures long-term memory backends such as [Mem0](https://mem0.ai/) or [MemMachine](https://memmachine.ai/) (note: MemMachine is experimental and is not recommended for production use). It follows the same format as the `llms` section. Refer to the [Memory Module](./memory.md) document for supported providers and examples.

### `retrievers`

This section configures retrievers for vector stores. It follows the same format as the `llms` section. Refer to the `examples/RAG/simple_rag` example workflow for an example on how this is used.

Refer to the [Retrievers](./retrievers.md) documentation for more information.

### Environment Variable Interpolation

NeMo Agent Toolkit supports environment variable interpolation in YAML configuration files using **braced** references: `${VAR}` and `${VAR:-default_value}`.

This allows you to:

1. Reference environment variables in your configuration
2. Provide default values if the environment variable is not set
3. Use empty strings as default values if needed
4. Keep literal `$` characters in string values when they are not part of a `${...}` reference

To illustrate this concept, an example from the `llms` section of the configuration file is provided below.

```yaml
llms:
  nim_llm:
    _type: nim
    base_url: ${NIM_BASE_URL:-"http://default.com"}  # Optional with default value
    api_key: ${NIM_API_KEY}  # Will use empty string if `NIM_API_KEY` not set
    model_name: ${MODEL_NAME:-}  # Will use empty string if `MODEL_NAME` not set
    temperature: 0.0
```

The environment variable interpolation process follows the rules below.

- `${VAR}` - Uses the value of environment variable `VAR`, or empty string if not set
- `${VAR:-default}` - Uses the value of environment variable `VAR`, or `default` if not set
- `${VAR:-}` - Uses the value of environment variable `VAR`, or empty string if not set

Bare `$VAR` (without braces) is not supported. Use `${VAR}` instead.

### Configuration Inheritance

NeMo Agent Toolkit supports configuration inheritance to reduce duplication across similar configuration files. Use the `base` key to reference a base configuration and selectively override specific values. For example, given a base configuration:

```yaml
# base-config.yml
llms:
  nim_llm:
    model_name: nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b
    temperature: 0.0
    max_tokens: 1024
```

A variant configuration can inherit from it and override specific values:

```yaml
# config-variant.yml
base: base-config.yml
llms:
  nim_llm:
    temperature: 0.9  # Override specific value
```

When you run a workflow using `config-variant.yml`, the configurations are combined so that values in the variant (such as `temperature: 0.9`) override those in the base, while unspecified values (such as `model_name` and `max_tokens`) are inherited. This feature also supports:

- **Relative or absolute paths**: Base paths are resolved relative to the current configuration file's directory
- **Chained inheritance**: Configurations can inherit from other variants (such as `base.yml` → `variant.yml` → `variant-debug.yml`)
- **Error detection**: The system detects circular dependencies and missing base files

See `examples/config_inheritance` for a complete example demonstrating different inheritance patterns and use cases.

### Loading Content from Files

NeMo Agent Toolkit supports loading string content from external files using the `file://` prefix. Any string field in the configuration can reference a file. This is useful for:

- Managing long prompts or descriptions separately from configuration files
- Version controlling content independently
- Sharing content across multiple configurations
- Using text editors with syntax highlighting for prompt development

To load content from a file, use the `file://` prefix followed by the file path:

```yaml
workflow:
  _type: react_agent
  llm_name: nim_llm
  tool_names: [calculator]
  system_prompt: file://../prompts/system_prompt.txt

functions:
  my_tool:
    _type: my_tool
    description: file://descriptions/my_tool.md
```

The file loading follows these rules:

- **Value format**: The value must start with `file://`
- **Path resolution**: Relative paths are resolved from the configuration file's directory. Absolute paths are also supported
- **Allowed extensions**: For security, only these file extensions are permitted: `.txt`, `.md`, `.j2`, `.jinja2`, `.jinja`, `.prompt`, `.tpl`, `.template`

:::{note}
The file content is loaded as plain text. Jinja2 template rendering is not performed during loading—the content is inserted exactly as written in the file.

See `examples/prompt_from_file` for a complete working example.
