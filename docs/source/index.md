# NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit Overview

NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit is a flexible, lightweight, and unifying library that allows you to easily connect existing enterprise [agents](./components/agents/index.md) to data sources and [tools](./build-workflows/functions-and-function-groups/functions.md#agents-and-tools) across any framework.

## Install

::::{tab-set}
:sync-group: install-tool

:::{tab-item} uv
:selected:
:sync: uv

```bash
uv pip install nvidia-nat
```

:::

:::{tab-item} pip
:sync: pip

```bash
pip install nvidia-nat
```

For detailed installation instructions, including optional dependencies, please refer to the [Install Guide](./get-started/installation.md).

## Key Features

- [**Framework Agnostic:**](./components/integrations/frameworks.md) NeMo Agent Toolkit works side-by-side and around existing agentic frameworks, such as [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/), [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/), [Microsoft Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/), [Google ADK](https://github.com/google/adk-python), as well as customer enterprise frameworks and simple Python agents. This allows you to use your current technology stack without replatforming. NeMo Agent Toolkit complements any existing agentic framework or [memory](./build-workflows/memory.md) tool you're using and isn't tied to any specific agentic framework, long-term memory, or data source.

- [**Reusability:**](./components/sharing-components.md) Every agent, tool, and agentic [workflow](./build-workflows/about-building-workflows.md) in this library exists as a function call that works together in complex software applications. The composability between these agents, tools, and workflows allows you to build once and reuse in different scenarios.

- [**Rapid Development:**](./get-started/tutorials/index.md) Start with a pre-built agent, tool, or workflow, and customize it to your needs. This allows you and your development teams to move quickly if you're already developing with agents.

- [**Profiling:**](./improve-workflows/profiler.md) Use the profiler to profile entire workflows down to the tool and agent level, track input/output tokens and timings, and identify bottlenecks.

- [**Observability:**](./run-workflows/observe/observe.md) Monitor and debug your workflows with dedicated integrations for popular observability platforms such as LangSmith, Phoenix, Weave, and Langfuse, plus compatibility with OpenTelemetry-based systems. Track performance, trace execution flows, and gain insights into your agent behaviors.

- [**Evaluation System:**](./improve-workflows/evaluate.md) Validate and maintain accuracy of agentic workflows with built-in evaluation tools.

- [**User Interface:**](./run-workflows/launching-ui.md) Use the NeMo Agent Toolkit UI chat interface to interact with your agents, visualize output, and debug workflows.

- [**Full MCP Support:**](./build-workflows/mcp-client.md) Compatible with [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). You can use NeMo Agent Toolkit as an [MCP client](./build-workflows/mcp-client.md) to connect to and use tools served by remote MCP servers. You can also publish tools with the [MCP server](./run-workflows/mcp-server.md) runtime or an MCP server using the [FastMCP server runtime](./run-workflows/fastmcp-server.md).

- [**A2A Protocol Support:**](./components/integrations/a2a.md) Compatible with [Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org). You can use NeMo Agent Toolkit as an [A2A client](./build-workflows/a2a-client.md) to connect to and delegate tasks to remote A2A agents. You can also use NeMo Agent Toolkit as an [A2A server](./run-workflows/a2a-server.md) to publish workflows as discoverable A2A agents.

## Hello World Example

Before getting started, it's possible to run this simple workflow and many other examples in Google Colab with no setup. Click here to open the introduction notebook: [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/).

1. Install NeMo Agent Toolkit along with the LangChain integration plugin:

   ::::{tab-set}
   :sync-group: install-tool

   :::{tab-item} uv
   :selected:
   :sync: uv

   ```bash
   uv pip install "nvidia-nat[langchain]"
   ```

   :::

   :::{tab-item} pip
   :sync: pip

   ```bash
   pip install "nvidia-nat[langchain]"
   ```

   :::

   ::::

2. Ensure you have set the `NVIDIA_API_KEY` environment variable to allow the example to use NVIDIA NIMs. An API key can be obtained by visiting [`build.nvidia.com`](https://build.nvidia.com/) and creating an account.

   ```bash
   export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
   ```

3. Create the NeMo Agent Toolkit workflow configuration file. This file will define the agents, tools, and workflows that will be used in the example. Save the following as `workflow.yml`:

   ```yaml
   functions:
     # Add a tool to search wikipedia
     wikipedia_search:
       _type: wiki_search
       max_results: 2

   llms:
     # Tell NeMo Agent Toolkit which LLM to use for the agent
     nim_llm:
       _type: nim
       model_name: nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b
       temperature: 0.0
       chat_template_kwargs:
         enable_thinking: false

   workflow:
     # Use an agent that 'reasons' and 'acts'
     _type: react_agent
     # Give it access to our wikipedia search tool
     tool_names: [wikipedia_search]
     # Tell it which LLM to use
     llm_name: nim_llm
     # Make it verbose
     verbose: true
     # Retry up to 3 times
     parse_agent_response_max_retries: 3
   ```

4. Run the Hello World example using the `nat` CLI and the `workflow.yml` file.

   ```bash
   nat run --config_file workflow.yml --input "List five subspecies of Aardvarks"
   ```

   This will run the workflow and output the results to the console.

   ```console
   Workflow Result:
   ['Here are five subspecies of Aardvarks:\n\n1. Orycteropus afer afer (Southern aardvark)\n2. O. a. adametzi  Grote, 1921 (Western aardvark)\n3. O. a. aethiopicus  Sundevall, 1843\n4. O. a. angolensis  Zukowsky & Haltenorth, 1957\n5. O. a. erikssoni  Lönnberg, 1906']
   ```
