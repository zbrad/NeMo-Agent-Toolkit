# Profiling and Performance Monitoring of NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit Workflows

The NeMo Agent Toolkit Profiler Module provides profiling and forecasting capabilities for [workflows](../build-workflows/about-building-workflows.md). The profiler instruments the workflow execution by:
- Collecting usage statistics in real time (using callbacks).
- Recording the usage statistics on a per-invocation basis (for example, tokens used, time between calls, and [LLM](../build-workflows/llms/index.md) calls).
- Storing the data for offline analysis.
- Forecasting usage metrics using time-series style models (for example, linear, random forest)
- Computing workflow specific metrics for performance analysis (for example, latency, and throughput).
- Analyzing workflow performance measures such as bottlenecks, latency, and concurrency spikes.

These functionalities will allow NeMo Agent Toolkit developers to dynamically stress test their workflows in pre-production phases to receive workflow-specific sizing guidance based on observed latency and throughput of their specific workflows
At any or every stage in a workflow execution, the NeMo Agent Toolkit profiler generates predictions/forecasts about future token and [tool](../build-workflows/functions-and-function-groups/functions.md#agents-and-tools) usage. Client-side forecasting allows for workflow-specific predictions, which can be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve server-side in order to facilitate inference planning.
Will allow for features such as offline-replay or simulation of workflow runs without the need for deployed infrastructure such as tooling/vector DBs, etc. Will also allow for NeMo Agent Toolkit native observability and workflow fingerprinting.

## Prerequisites

## Current Profiler Architecture
The NeMo Agent Toolkit Profiler can be broken into the following components:

### Profiler Decorators and Callbacks
- `packages/nvidia_nat_profiler/src/nat/plugins/profiler/decorators` directory defines decorators that can wrap each workflow or LLM framework context manager to inject usage-collection callbacks.
- `packages/nvidia_nat_profiler/src/nat/plugins/profiler/callbacks` directory implements callback handlers. These handlers track usage statistics (tokens, time, inputs/outputs) and push them to the NeMo Agent Toolkit usage stats queue. We currently support callback handlers for LangChain/LangGraph,
LlamaIndex, CrewAI, Google ADK, and Semantic Kernel.

### Profiler Runner

- `packages/nvidia_nat_profiler/src/nat/plugins/profiler/profile_runner.py` is the main orchestration class. It collects workflow run statistics from the NeMo Agent Toolkit [Eval](./evaluate.md) module, computed workflow-specific metrics, and optionally forecasts usage metrics using the Profiler module.

- Under `packages/nvidia_nat_profiler/src/nat/plugins/profiler/forecasting`, the code trains scikit-learn style models on the usage data.
model_trainer.py can train a LinearModel or a RandomForestModel on the aggregated usage data (the raw statistics collected).
base_model.py, linear_model.py, and random_forest_regressor.py define the abstract base and specific scikit-learn wrappers.

- Under `packages/nvidia_nat_profiler/src/nat/plugins/profiler/inference_optimization` we have several metrics that can be computed out evaluation traces of your workflow including workflow latency, commonly used prompt prefixes for caching, identifying workflow bottlenecks, and concurrency analysis.

### CLI Integrations
Native integrations with `nat eval` to allow for running of the profiler through a unified evaluation interface. Configurability is exposed through a workflow YAML configuration file consistent with evaluation configurations.


## Using the Profiler

### Step 1: Enabling Instrumentation on a Workflow [Optional]
**NOTE:** If you don't set it, NeMo Agent Toolkit will inspect your code to infer frameworks used. We recommend you set it explicitly.
To enable profiling on a workflow, you need to wrap the workflow with the profiler decorators. The decorators can be applied to any workflow using the `framework_wrappers` argument of the `register_function` decorator.
Simply specify which NeMo Agent Toolkit supported frameworks you will be using anywhere in your workflow (including tools) upon registration and the toolkit will automatically apply the appropriate profiling decorators at build time.
For example:

```python
@register_function(config_type=WebQueryToolConfig, framework_wrappers=[LLMFrameworkEnum.LANGCHAIN])
async def webquery_tool(config: WebQueryToolConfig, builder: Builder):
```

Once workflows are instrumented, the profiler will collect usage statistics in real time and store them for offline analysis for any LLM invocations or tool calls your workflow makes during execution. Runtime telemetry
is stored in a `intermediate_steps_stream` context variable during runtime. NeMo Agent Toolkit has a subscriber that will read intermediate steps through eval.

Even if a function isn’t one of the built-in NeMo Agent Toolkit “Functions”, you can still profile it with our simple decorator. The `@track_function` decorator helps you capture details such as when a function starts and ends, its input arguments, and its output—even if the function is asynchronous, a generator, or a class method.

#### How It Works

The decorator automatically logs key events in three stages:
- **`SPAN_START`:** Logged when the function begins executing. It records the serialized inputs.
- **`SPAN_CHUNK`:** For generator functions, each yielded value is captured as it’s produced.
- **`SPAN_END`:** Logged when the function finishes executing. It records the serialized output.

It supports all kinds of functions:
- **Synchronous functions & methods**
- **Asynchronous functions**
- **Generators (both `sync` and `async`)**

#### Key Benefits

- **Broad Compatibility:**
  Use this decorator on any Python function, regardless of its type.

- **Simple Metadata:**
  Optionally pass a dictionary of metadata to add extra context about the function call.

- **Automatic Data Serialization:**
  The decorator converts input arguments and outputs into a `JSON`-friendly format (with special handling for Pydantic models), making the data easier to analyze.

- **Reactive Event Streaming:**
  All profiling events are pushed to the `NeMo Agent Toolkit` intermediate step stream, so you can subscribe and monitor events in real time.

#### How to Use

Just decorate your custom function with `@track_function` and provide any optional metadata if needed:

```python
from nat.plugins.profiler.decorators.function_tracking import track_function

@track_function(metadata={"action": "compute", "source": "custom_function"})
def my_custom_function(a, b):
    # Your function logic here
    return a + b
```

### Step 2: Configuring the Profiler with Eval
The profiler can be run through the `nat eval` command. The profiler can be configured through the `profiler` section of the workflow configuration file. The following is an example `eval` configuration section from the `simple` workflow which shows how to enable the profiler:

```yaml
eval:
  general:
    output_dir: ./.tmp/nat/examples/getting_started/simple_web_query/
    dataset:
      _type: json
      file_path: examples/evaluation_and_profiling/simple_web_query_eval/data/langsmith.json
    profiler:
      # Compute inter query token uniqueness
      token_uniqueness_forecast: true
      # Compute expected workflow runtime
      workflow_runtime_forecast: true
      # Compute inference optimization metrics
      compute_llm_metrics: true
      # Avoid dumping large text into the output CSV (helpful to not break structure)
      csv_exclude_io_text: true
      # Idenitfy common prompt prefixes
      prompt_caching_prefixes:
        enable: true
        min_frequency: 0.1
      bottleneck_analysis:
        # Can also be simple_stack
        enable_nested_stack: true
      concurrency_spike_analysis:
        enable: true
        spike_threshold: 7
      # Build a prediction trie for Dynamo routing hints
      prediction_trie:
        enable: true
        # Auto-compute latency sensitivity per LLM call position
        auto_sensitivity: true
        sensitivity_scale: 5
        # Weights for the three scoring signals (must sum to 1.0)
        w_critical: 0.5
        w_fanout: 0.3
        w_position: 0.2
        # Penalty for LLM calls that run in parallel with longer siblings (default 0.0)
        w_parallel: 0.0

  evaluators:
    accuracy:
      _type: ragas
      metric: AnswerAccuracy
      llm_name: nim_rag_eval_llm
    groundedness:
      _type: ragas
      metric: ResponseGroundedness
      llm_name: nim_rag_eval_llm
    relevance:
      _type: ragas
      metric: ContextRelevance
      llm_name: nim_rag_eval_llm
    trajectory_accuracy:
      _type: trajectory
      llm_name: nim_trajectory_eval_llm
```

Please also note the `output_dir` parameter which specifies the directory where the profiler output will be stored. Let us explore the profiler configuration options:
- `token_uniqueness_forecast`: Compute the inter-query token uniqueness forecast. This computes the expected number of unique tokens in the next query based on the tokens used in the previous queries.
- `workflow_runtime_forecast`: Compute the expected workflow runtime forecast. This computes the expected runtime of the workflow based on the runtime of the previous queries.
- `compute_llm_metrics`: Compute inference optimization metrics. This computes workflow-specific metrics for performance analysis (e.g., latency, throughput, etc.).
- `csv_exclude_io_text`: Avoid dumping large text into the output CSV. This is helpful to not break the structure of the CSV output.
- `prompt_caching_prefixes`: Identify common prompt prefixes. This is helpful for identifying if you have commonly repeated prompts that can be pre-populated in KV caches
- `bottleneck_analysis`: Analyze workflow performance measures such as bottlenecks, latency, and concurrency spikes. This can be set to `simple_stack` for a simpler analysis. Nested stack will provide a more detailed analysis identifying nested bottlenecks like tool calls inside other tools calls.
- `concurrency_spike_analysis`: Analyze concurrency spikes. This will identify if there are any spikes in the number of concurrent tool calls. At a `spike_threshold` of 7, the profiler will identify any spikes where the number of concurrent running functions is greater than or equal to 7. Those are surfaced to the user in a dedicated section of the workflow profiling report.
- `prediction_trie`: Build a prediction trie from execution traces for `Dynamo` routing hint injection at runtime. See the [Prediction Trie](#prediction-trie-and-dynamo-routing-hints) section below for details.

### Step 3: Running the Profiler

To run the profiler, simply run the `nat eval` command with the workflow configuration file. The profiler will collect usage statistics and store them in the output directory specified in the configuration file.

```bash
nat eval --config_file examples/evaluation_and_profiling/simple_web_query_eval/configs/eval_config.yml
```

This will, based on the above configuration, produce the following files in the `output_dir` specified in the configuration file:

- `all_requests_profiler_traces.json` : This file contains the raw usage statistics collected by the profiler. Includes raw traces of LLM and tool input, runtimes, and other metadata.
- `inference_optimization.json`: This file contains the computed workflow-specific metrics. This includes 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence intervals for latency, throughput, and workflow runtime.
- `standardized_data_all.csv`: This file contains the standardized usage data including prompt tokens, completion tokens, LLM input, framework, and other metadata.
- You'll also find a JSON file and text report of any advanced or experimental techniques you ran including concurrency analysis, bottleneck analysis, or PrefixSpan.
- `prediction_trie.json`: When `prediction_trie.enable` is set to `true`, this file contains the prediction trie — a hierarchical model of your workflow's LLM call patterns. See below for details.


## Prediction Trie and Dynamo Routing Hints

```{note}
The Dynamo integration is experimental and requires **Dynamo >= 1.1.0**. See [NVIDIA Dynamo (experimental)](../build-workflows/llms/index.md#nvidia-dynamo-experimental).
```

The prediction trie is a hierarchical data structure built from profiling traces that captures per-LLM-call-position statistics for your workflow. When deployed with a `Dynamo` LLM backend, these statistics are injected as routing hints to optimize `KV` cache management and request scheduling.

### What the Prediction Trie Captures

During profiling, the `trie` builder processes all LLM call events and, for each unique position in your workflow's call graph (identified by `function path` and `call index`), accumulates:

- **Remaining calls**: How many more LLM calls are expected after this one in the workflow.
- **`Interarrival` time**: Expected time in milliseconds until the next LLM call.
- **Output tokens**: Expected output token count for this call (with `p50`, `p90`, `p95` percentiles).
- **Latency sensitivity** (when `auto_sensitivity` is enabled): An auto-computed score indicating how latency-critical this particular call is.

Each metric is aggregated across all profiled traces, producing robust percentile-based predictions.

### Auto Latency Sensitivity

When `auto_sensitivity` is enabled (the default), the profiler automatically determines which LLM calls in your workflow are most latency-critical using three composite signals:

**Critical path weight** (`w_critical`, default 0.5): What fraction of the workflow's total wall-clock time does this call consume? Calls that dominate overall latency score highest.

**Downstream fan-out** (`w_fanout`, default 0.3): How many subsequent LLM calls depend on this call completing? A planning call that gates 5 downstream tool calls scores higher than a leaf call with no dependents.

**User-facing position** (`w_position`, default 0.2): First and last calls in a workflow get boosted sensitivity because they directly affect perceived latency (time-to-first-activity and time-to-final-answer).

**Parallel sibling slack** (`w_parallel`, default 0.0): When an LLM call runs concurrently with a longer sibling task (e.g., a database query or tool call), the LLM call is not on the critical path — the parent waits for the slowest child. The profiler detects this by grouping spans under the same parent and computing how much "slack" the LLM call has relative to its longest overlapping sibling. A call entirely shadowed by a 5x longer sibling gets a slack ratio near 1.0, while a call that is itself the longest sibling gets 0.0. This signal is subtracted from the composite score, reducing sensitivity for calls that have room to be slower without affecting overall latency. Set `w_parallel` to a positive value (e.g., 0.2–0.3) to enable this signal.

These signals are normalized to [0, 1], combined with the configured weights, and mapped to an integer scale from 1 to `sensitivity_scale`. The result is stored alongside each prediction in the `trie`.

#### Override behavior

Auto-computed sensitivity only applies when no manual `@latency_sensitive` decorator is active. If a developer explicitly annotates a function, the manual value always takes precedence:

| Scenario | Effective sensitivity |
|----------|----------------------|
| No decorator, no `trie` prediction | Default (2) |
| No decorator, `trie` says 4 | Auto (4) |
| `@latency_sensitive(5)`, `trie` says 3 | Manual (5) |
| `@latency_sensitive(1)`, `trie` says 4 | Manual (1) |

### Enabling the Prediction Trie

Add the `prediction_trie` section to your profiler config:

```yaml
profiler:
  prediction_trie:
    enable: true
    # Auto latency sensitivity (enabled by default)
    auto_sensitivity: true
    sensitivity_scale: 5       # Integer range [1, N] for sensitivity scores
    w_critical: 0.5            # Weight for critical path signal
    w_fanout: 0.3              # Weight for fan-out signal
    w_position: 0.2            # Weight for position signal
    w_parallel: 0.0            # Penalty for parallel sibling slack (0.0 = disabled)
```

After running `nat eval`, the profiler writes `prediction_trie.json` to your output directory.

### Using the Prediction Trie at Runtime

To use the `trie` for `Dynamo` routing, set the `prediction_trie_path` on your `Dynamo` LLM config:

```yaml
llms:
  my_dynamo_llm:
    _type: dynamo
    model: my-model
    base_url: http://dynamo-endpoint:8000/v1
    prediction_trie_path: ./.tmp/eval/output/prediction_trie.json
```

At runtime, the `Dynamo` transport automatically:
1. Looks up the current `function path` and `call index` in the `trie`.
2. Overrides static routing hints (`output tokens`, `interarrival time`, `remaining calls`) with per-call-position predictions from profiler data.
3. If the prediction includes an auto-computed `latency_sensitivity` and no manual `@latency_sensitive` decorator is active, uses the auto value for priority computation.
4. Injects all hints into `nvext.agent_hints` in the request body for the `Dynamo` backend.

This means you can profile once, then deploy with intelligent per-call routing — no manual annotation required.

### Manual Latency Sensitivity

For cases where you have domain knowledge the profiler cannot observe (e.g., a call feeds a real-time UI), you can manually annotate functions:

```python
from nat.plugins.profiler.decorators.latency import latency_sensitive

@latency_sensitive(5)
async def user_facing_response():
    """This call directly produces output the user sees."""
    return await llm.generate(prompt)
```

Manual annotations always override auto-computed values when both are present.


## Walkthrough of Profiling a Workflow
In this guide, we will walk you through an end-to-end example of how to profile a NeMo Agent Toolkit workflow using the NeMo Agent Toolkit profiler, which is part of the library's evaluation harness.
We will begin by creating a workflow to profile, explore some of the configuration options of the profiler, and then perform an in-depth analysis of the profiling results.

### Defining a Workflow
For this guide, we will use a simple, but useful, workflow that analyzes the body of a given email to determine if it is a Phishing email. We will define a single tool that takes an email body as input and returns a response on
whether the email is a Phishing email or not. We will then add that tool as the only tool available to the agent pre-built in the NeMo Agent Toolkit library. Below is the implementation of the phishing tool. The source code for this example can be found at `examples/evaluation_and_profiling/email_phishing_analyzer/`.

### Configuring the Workflow
The configuration file for the workflow is as follows. Here, pay close attention to how the `profiler` and `eval` sections are configured.

```yaml
## CONFIGURATION OPTIONS OMITTED HERE FOR BREVITY

functions:
  email_phishing_analyzer:
    _type: email_phishing_analyzer
    llm: nim_llm
    prompt: |
      Examine the following email content and determine if it exhibits signs of malicious intent. Look for any
        suspicious signals that may indicate phishing, such as requests for personal information or suspicious tone.

      Email content:
      {body}

      Return your findings as a JSON object with these fields:

      - is_likely_phishing: (boolean) true if phishing is suspected
      - explanation: (string) detailed explanation of your reasoning


## OTHER CONFIGURATION OPTIONS OMITTED FOR BREVITY

eval:
  general:
    output_dir: ./.tmp/eval/examples/evaluation_and_profiling/email_phishing_analyzer/test_models/llama-3.1-8b-instruct
    verbose: true
    dataset:
        _type: csv
        file_path: examples/evaluation_and_profiling/email_phishing_analyzer/data/smaller_test.csv
        id_key: "subject"
        structure:
          question_key: body
          answer_key: label

    profiler:
        token_uniqueness_forecast: true
        workflow_runtime_forecast: true
        compute_llm_metrics: true
        csv_exclude_io_text: true
        prompt_caching_prefixes:
          enable: true
          min_frequency: 0.1
        bottleneck_analysis:
          # Can also be simple_stack
          enable_nested_stack: true
        concurrency_spike_analysis:
          enable: true
          spike_threshold: 7

```

Diving deeper into the `eval` section, we see that the `profiler` section is configured with the following options:
- `token_uniqueness_forecast`: Compute inter query token uniqueness
- `workflow_runtime_forecast`: Compute expected workflow runtime
- `compute_llm_metrics`: Compute inference optimization metrics
- `csv_exclude_io_text`: Avoid dumping large text into the output CSV (helpful to not break structure)
- `prompt_caching_prefixes`: Identify common prompt prefixes
- `bottleneck_analysis`: Enable bottleneck analysis
- `concurrency_spike_analysis`: Enable concurrency spike analysis. Set the `spike_threshold` to 7, meaning that any concurrency spike above 7 will be raised to the user specifically.

We also we see the `evaluators` section, which includes the following metrics:
- `accuracy`: Evaluates the accuracy of the answer generated by the workflow against the expected answer or ground truth.
- `groundedness`: Evaluates the `groundedness` of the response generated by the workflow based on the context retrieved by the workflow.
- `relevance`: Evaluates the relevance of the context retrieved by the workflow against the question.

### Running the Profiler

> *Note*: The models used in the following sections were models available at the time of writing on [`build.nvidia.com`](https://build.nvidia.com) some of these have been deprecated and are no longer available. Use the models that are available to you at the time of running the profiler.

To run the profiler, simply run the `nat eval` command with the workflow configuration file. The profiler will collect usage statistics and store them in the output directory specified in the configuration file.


```bash
nat eval --config_file examples/evaluation_and_profiling/email_phishing_analyzer/configs/<config_file>.yml
```

Among other files, this will produce a `standardized_data_all.csv` file in the `output_dir` specified in the configuration file. This file will contain the profiling results of the workflow that we will use for the rest of the analysis.

### Analyzing the Profiling Results
The remainder of this guide will demonstrate how to perform a simple analysis of the profiling results using the `standardized_data_all.csv` file to compare the performance of various LLMs and evaluate the efficiency of the workflow.
Ultimately, we will use the collected telemetry data to identify which LLM we think is the best fit for our workflow.

Particularly, we evaluate the following models:
- `meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct`
- `meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct`
- `mistralai/mistral-large-3-675b-instruct-2512`
- `mistralai/mistral-small-4-119b-2603`
- `nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b`
- `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b`

Each of the above models has an associated workflow in the `examples/evaluation_and_profiling/email_phishing_analyzer/configs` directory. We run evaluation of the workflow on a small dataset of emails and compare the performance of the LLMs based on the metrics provided by the profiler. Once we run `nat eval`, we can analyze the `standardized_data_all.csv` file to compare the performance of the LLMs.

Henceforth, we assume that you have run the `nat eval` command and have the `standardized_data_all.csv` file in the `output_dir` specified in the configuration file. Please also take a moment to create a CSV file containing the concatenated results of the LLMs you wish to compare.

### Plotting Prompt vs Completion Tokens for LLMs
One of the first things we can do is to plot the prompt vs completion tokens for each LLM. This will give us an idea of how the LLMs are performing in terms of token usage. We can use the `standardized_data_all.csv` file to plot this data.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns

df = pd.read_csv("standardized_data_all.csv")
# Filter LLM_END events
df_llm_end = df[df["event_type"] == "LLM_END"]

# Plot scatter plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(14, 6))
sns.scatterplot(
    data=df_llm_end,
    x="prompt_tokens",
    y="completion_tokens",
    hue="llm_name",
    style="function_name",
    s=100,  # Marker size
    ax=ax
)

# Customize the plot
ax.set_xlabel("Prompt Tokens", fontsize=12)
ax.set_ylabel("Completion Tokens", fontsize=12)
ax.set_title("Prompt Tokens vs Completion Tokens by LLM and Function", fontsize=14)
ax.legend(title="LLM / Function", bbox_to_anchor=(1.02, 1), loc="upper left", borderaxespad=0)
ax.grid(True)
fig.subplots_adjust(right=0.65)
plt.show()
```

The plot will show the prompt tokens on the x-axis and the completion tokens on the y-axis. Each point represents a completion event by an LLM for a given prompt. The color of the point represents the LLM used, and the style represents the function used.
Below is an example of what the plot might look like:

![Prompt vs Completion Tokens](../_static/profiler_token_scatter.png)

We see from the image above that the `llama-3.1-8b-instruct` and `llama-3.3-70b-instruct` LLMs have the highest prompt token usage, perhaps indicating that they fail at tool calling.

### Analyzing Workflow Runtimes
Another important metric to analyze is the workflow runtime. We can use the `standardized_data_all.csv` file to plot the workflow runtime for each LLM. This will give us an idea of how long each LLM takes to complete the workflow and compare if some LLMs are more efficient than others.

```python
df["event_timestamp"] = pd.to_numeric(df["event_timestamp"])

# Filter only LLM_START and LLM_END events
df_llm = df[df["event_type"].isin(["LLM_START", "LLM_END"])]

# Group by example_number and llm_name to get first LLM_START and last LLM_END timestamps
df_runtime = df_llm.groupby(["example_number", "llm_name"]).agg(
    start_time=("event_timestamp", "min"),
    end_time=("event_timestamp", "max")
).reset_index()

# Compute runtime
df_runtime["runtime_seconds"] = df_runtime["end_time"] - df_runtime["start_time"]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.boxplot(
    data=df_runtime,
    x="llm_name",
    y="runtime_seconds",
    hue="llm_name"
)

# Set log scale for y-axis
plt.yscale("log")

# Customize the plot
plt.xlabel("LLM Model", fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel("Runtime (log10 scale, seconds)", fontsize=12)
plt.title("Example Runtime per LLM Model (Log Scale)", fontsize=14)
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.grid(True, which="both", linestyle="--", linewidth=0.5)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

We use the log scale for the y-axis to better visualize the runtime differences between the LLMs. The box plot will show the runtime of each LLM model for each example in the dataset. Below is an example of what the plot might look like:
![LLM Runtime](../_static/profiler_runtimes.png)

From the image above, we see that the `mistral-large-3-675b-instruct-2512` LLM has both the highest runtime and the widest range of runtimes. Indicating that in the worst-case takes the longest to complete the workflow.

### Analyzing Token Efficiency
Let us collect one more piece of information from the `standardized_data_all.csv` file to compare the performance of the LLMs. We will look at the total prompt and completion tokens generated by each LLM to determine which LLM is the most efficient in terms of token usage.

```python
# Aggregate total prompt and completion tokens per example and LLM
df_tokens = df_llm_end.groupby(["example_number",
                                "llm_name"]).agg(total_prompt_tokens=("prompt_tokens", "sum"),
                                                 total_completion_tokens=("completion_tokens", "sum")).reset_index()

# Reshape data for plotting
df_tokens_melted = df_tokens.melt(id_vars=["example_number", "llm_name"],
                                  value_vars=["total_prompt_tokens", "total_completion_tokens"],
                                  var_name="Token Type",
                                  value_name="Token Count")

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(14, 8))
sns.barplot(data=df_tokens_melted, x="llm_name", y="Token Count", hue="Token Type", errorbar=None, ax=ax)

# Set log scale for y-axis
plt.yscale("log")

# Customize the plot
plt.xlabel("LLM Model", fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel("Total Token Count per Example (log10 scale)", fontsize=12)
plt.title("Total Prompt and Completion Tokens per Example by LLM Model (Log Scale)", fontsize=14)
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.legend(title="Token Type", loc="upper left", bbox_to_anchor=(1.01, 1), borderaxespad=0)
plt.grid(axis="y", linestyle="--", linewidth=0.5, which="both")
fig.tight_layout(rect=(0, 0, 0.88, 1))
plt.savefig('profiler_token_efficiency.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches="tight")
plt.show()
```

The bar plot will show the total prompt and completion tokens generated by each LLM for each example in the dataset. Below is an example of what the plot might look like:
![Token Efficiency](../_static/profiler_token_efficiency.png)

We see that the `llama-3.3-70b-instruct` LLM generates the most tokens, indicating that it is the most verbose model. The `mistral-large-3-675b-instruct-2512` LLM generates the fewest tokens, indicating that it is the most efficient model in terms of token usage.

### Understanding Where the Models Spend Time
We can also analyze the bottleneck analysis provided by the profiler to understand where the LLMs spend most of their time. This can help us identify potential bottlenecks in the workflow and optimize the LLMs accordingly.
For example, we can explore why the `mistral-large-3-675b-instruct-2512` model has such a long runtime in the worst-case scenario. To do so, we can directly visualize the `Gantt charts` produced by the `nested stack analysis` in the `bottleneck_analysis` section of the profiler configuration for each model.
Let's look at one below:

![ time chart one ](../_static/mistral-large-3-675b-instruct-2512_gantt_chart.png)

It is interesting here that most of the latency comes from the initial invocation of the agent, wherein it reasons and decides on whether to call a tool. Subsequent steps take much less time in seconds, which is the axis of the `Gantt` chart.

On the other hand, the `nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b` model has a more balanced distribution of time across the workflow, indicating that it is more time-efficient model.

### Analyzing Ragas Metrics
Finally, we can analyze the Ragas metrics provided by the profiler to evaluate the performance of the LLMs. We can use the output of the `eval` harness to compare the accuracy, relevance, and groundedness of the responses generated by each LLM.

The accuracy, relevance, and groundedness metrics are stored in `accuracy_output.json`, `relevance_output.json`, and `groundedness_output.json` files in the output directory specified in the configuration file. We can read these files and plot the metrics for each LLM to compare their performance.

```python
import json
import os
from collections import OrderedDict
from pathlib import Path

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns

CUR_DIR = Path(os.getcwd())

MODELS = ("llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
          "llama-3.3-70b-instruct",
          "mistral-large-3-675b-instruct-2512",
          "mistral-small-4-119b-2603",
          "nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b",
          "nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b")

METRICS_FILE_NAMES = OrderedDict(Accuracy="accuracy_output.json",
                                 Relevance="relevance_output.json",
                                 Groundedness="groundedness_output.json")


def gather_model_metrics(model_dir: Path) -> dict:
    metrics = {}
    for metric_name, file_name in METRICS_FILE_NAMES.items():
        with open(model_dir / file_name, encoding="utf-8") as f:
            json_data = json.load(f)

        metrics[metric_name] = json_data["average_score"]

    return metrics


def gather_metrics() -> dict:
    all_metrics = {metric: {} for metric in METRICS_FILE_NAMES}
    for model_name in MODELS:
        model_dir_path = CUR_DIR / "test_models" / model_name
        try:
            model_metrics = gather_model_metrics(model_dir_path)
            for metric_name, score in model_metrics.items():
                all_metrics[metric_name][model_name] = score
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Problem gathering metrics for {model_name}: {e}. Skipping.")

    return all_metrics


def plot_metrics(all_metrics: dict):
    df = pd.DataFrame(all_metrics)
    df.reset_index(inplace=True)
    df.rename(columns={"index": "model"}, inplace=True)

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(14, 8))
    sns.barplot(data=df.melt(id_vars="model", var_name="metric", value_name="score"),
                x="model",
                y="score",
                hue="metric",
                errorbar=None,
                ax=ax)

    plt.xlabel("LLM Model", fontsize=12)
    plt.ylabel("Metric Score", fontsize=12)
    plt.title("Accuracy, Relevance, and Groundedness per Model", fontsize=14)
    plt.xticks(rotation=45)
    plt.legend(title="Metric", loc="upper left", bbox_to_anchor=(1.02, 1), borderaxespad=0)
    plt.grid(axis="y", linestyle="--", linewidth=0.5, which="both")
    fig.tight_layout(rect=(0, 0, 0.84, 1))
    plt.savefig('profiler_ragas_metrics.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches="tight")
    plt.show()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    all_metrics = gather_metrics()
    plot_metrics(all_metrics)
```

Below is plot visualizing the accuracy, relevance, and groundedness of the responses generated by each LLM:
![Ragas Metrics](../_static/profiler_ragas_metrics.png)

The Ragas metrics confirm that the `llama-3*` models are weak candidates for this workflow because their lower scores align with the tool-calling issues observed earlier. The two Nemotron models provide the best quality tradeoff, with strong `accuracy` and `groundedness` scores across the evaluation set. Of those, `nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b` is the strongest default choice because it preserves those quality scores, while slightly improving `relevance`. `nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b` remains a good alternative when latency or cost is the higher priority.


### Conclusion
In this guide, we walked through an end-to-end example of how to profile a NeMo Agent Toolkit workflow using the profiler. We defined a simple workflow, configured the profiler, ran the profiler, and analyzed the profiling results to compare the performance of various LLMs and evaluate the efficiency of the workflow. We used the collected telemetry data to identify which LLM we think is the best fit for our workflow. We hope this guide has given you a good understanding of how to profile a workflow and analyze the results to make informed decisions about your workflow configuration.

If you'd like to optimize further, we recommend exploring the `workflow_profiling_report.txt` file that was also created by the profiler. That has detailed information about workflow bottlenecks, and latency at various `concurrencies`, which can be helpful metrics when identifying performance issues in your workflow.
