## 🚀 Installation

Before you begin using NeMo Agent Toolkit, ensure that you have Python 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13 installed on your system.

> [!NOTE]
> For users who want to run the examples, it's required to clone the repository and install from source to get the necessary files required to run the examples. Please refer to the [Examples](./examples/README.md) documentation for more information.

To install the latest stable version of NeMo Agent Toolkit from PyPI, run the following command:

```bash
pip install nvidia-nat
```

NeMo Agent Toolkit has many optional dependencies that can be installed with the core package. Optional dependencies are grouped by framework. For example, to install the LangChain/LangGraph plugin, run the following:

```bash
pip install "nvidia-nat[langchain]"
```

Detailed installation instructions, including the full list of optional dependencies and their conflicts, can be found in the [Installation Guide](./docs/source/get-started/installation.md).

## 🌟 Hello World Example

Before getting started, it's possible to run this simple workflow and many other examples in Google Colab with no setup. Click here to open the introduction notebook: [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/).

1. Ensure you have set the `NVIDIA_API_KEY` environment variable to allow the example to use NVIDIA NIMs. An API key can be obtained by visiting [`build.nvidia.com`](https://build.nvidia.com/) and creating an account.

   ```bash
   export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
   ```

2. Create the NeMo Agent Toolkit workflow configuration file. This file will define the agents, tools, and workflows that will be used in the example. Save the following as `workflow.yml`:

   ```yaml
   functions:
      # Add a tool to search wikipedia
      wikipedia_search:
         _type: wiki_search
         max_results: 2

   llms:
      # Tell NeMo Agent Toolkit which LLM to use for the agent
      nim_llm:
         _type: nim
         model_name: nvidia/nemotron-3.5-lightning-30b-a3b
         temperature: 0.0
         chat_template_kwargs:
            enable_thinking: false

   workflow:
      # Use an agent that 'reasons' and 'acts'
      _type: react_agent
      # Give it access to our wikipedia search tool
      tool_names: [wikipedia_search]
      # Tell it which LLM to use
      llm_name: nim_llm
      # Make it verbose
      verbose: true
      # Retry up to 3 times
      parse_agent_response_max_retries: 3
   ```

3. Run the Hello World example using the `nat` CLI and the `workflow.yml` file.

   ```bash
   nat run --config_file workflow.yml --input "List five subspecies of Aardvarks"
   ```

   This will run the workflow and output the results to the console.

   ```console
   Workflow Result:
   ['Here are five subspecies of Aardvarks:\n\n1. Orycteropus afer afer (Southern aardvark)\n2. O. a. adametzi  Grote, 1921 (Western aardvark)\n3. O. a. aethiopicus  Sundevall, 1843\n4. O. a. angolensis  Zukowsky & Haltenorth, 1957\n5. O. a. erikssoni  Lönnberg, 1906']
   ```

## 📊 Telemetry

The NeMo Agent Toolkit includes runtime telemetry hooks for the `nat` command-line tool to help guide improvements. Telemetry is best-effort and never blocks or fails a CLI invocation. Once you opt in (see below), events are sent to the shared NeMo Usage Telemetry ingest.

### How consent works

The first time you run an interactive `nat` command, you'll see a one-time consent prompt explaining what is collected and asking whether to allow it. The prompt defaults to **yes** (pressing Enter accepts); type `n` to opt out. Your decision is persisted to `~/.config/nat/telemetry.toml` and respected on every subsequent invocation.

In **non-interactive contexts** (CI, cron, piped scripts, daemons), telemetry is **always off** unless you explicitly enable it via the environment variable below. We never send data when there's no opportunity to ask.

You can change your decision anytime:

```bash
nat configure telemetry --enable     # opt in
nat configure telemetry --disable    # opt out
nat configure telemetry --status     # show the current effective state
```

Or override the persisted decision (and skip the prompt) via environment variable:

```bash
export NAT_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false   # disable for this shell session
export NAT_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true    # enable for this shell session
```

The environment variable takes precedence over the persisted file. If both disagree, `nat configure telemetry --status` will tell you which one is winning.

### What is collected

For each `nat` command invocation, a single event is sent at exit containing:

- The top-level command name, such as `run`, `serve`, or `evaluate`.
- The second-level command name when applicable, such as `list-components` for `nat info list-components`.
- The outcome: `success`, `failure`, or `interrupted`.
- The wall-clock duration in milliseconds.
- The process exit code.
- The Python class name of the raised exception on failure (the message is not collected).
- The Python runtime version, such as `3.11.7`.

### What is not collected

The following are never collected:

- Command arguments or option values.
- Workflow names, function names, model names, or any contents of configuration files.
- File paths, hostnames, usernames, IP addresses, or any other identifying information.
- The output of any command.
